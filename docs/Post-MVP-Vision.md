Of course. Here is the finalized **`Post-MVP Vision.md`** document. It is structured as a formal strategic guide for the team, based on the excellent plan we just developed.

I recommend you save this content as a new file in your project: `docs/Post-MVP Vision.md`.

### **PromptReady - Post-MVP Vision & Roadmap**

*   **Status:** FINAL
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Purpose:** This document outlines the strategic product vision for PromptReady *following* a successful MVP launch. It serves as a North Star for future development, guiding the evolution from a lean utility into a comprehensive, professional-grade content processing platform.

#### **Introduction**

This roadmap is contingent on the successful validation of the "Metered Freemium to BYOK" model defined in the MVP. Upon achieving our primary validation metrics, we will begin executing the following phased plan to build upon our initial success, expand our user base, and create a sustainable, feature-rich service.

---

### **Phase 2: The Pro Power-User Platform**

*Once the MVP has proven product-market fit, the next priority is to enhance the Pro experience and introduce a seamless, fully-hosted subscription model.*

*   **Frictionless SaaS Model:** Introduce a fully hosted premium tier with direct credit card subscriptions and managed API usage. This will provide a seamless alternative to the BYOK plan, catering to a broader professional audience.
*   **Advanced Model Selection:** Allow Pro users (both SaaS and BYOK) to choose from a variety of powerful AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus) to suit their specific needs and budget.
*   **Content Processing Pipelines (#8):** Introduce a "Pipelines" feature, allowing users to create, save, and share custom, multi-step workflows (e.g., `Clean ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Translate ‚Üí Export`). This is the first major step toward a truly programmable content engine.
*   **History & Favorites:** Implement a user dashboard to save and access processing history and bookmark frequently used configurations and pipelines.

---

### **Phase 3: The Multi-Modal Content Engine**

*With a mature Pro offering, the long-term vision is to expand beyond web text into a comprehensive platform that can ingest, process, and analyze multiple content types.*

#### **Multi-Modal Ingestion**
*   **OCR & Transcript Processing (#10, #11):** Expand beyond web content to handle new sources, allowing users to process text from images (screenshots, diagrams) and audio/video transcripts.

#### **Advanced Content Management**
*   **Multi-Page Binder (#12):** Allow users to collect and process content from multiple URLs into a single, cohesive "binder" or project, enabling large-scale research and content curation.
*   **Content Deduplication (#13):** Intelligently identify and offer to merge duplicate or semantically similar content within a project binder.

#### **AI-Powered Insights**
*   **Entity Extraction (#14):** Move beyond simple cleaning to intelligent analysis by automatically identifying and tagging key entities (people, places, products, concepts) within the cleaned content.

#### **Platform & Integrations**
*   **Public API & Integrations:** Offer a public API to allow other applications and services to leverage our powerful content processing engine, enabling direct integrations with platforms like Notion, Obsidian, Zapier, and other professional workflows.

## üßô **PromptReady Application Upgrade Analysis Complete**

I've analyzed your application against the new PRD v3.0 and created a comprehensive upgrade plan. Here's what I found:

### **üìä Current State vs New Requirements**

**‚úÖ What's Already Working:**
- WXT Manifest V3 extension framework
- Offline mode (content capture, cleaning, structuring)
- BYOK client implementation
- React-based popup with settings panel
- Content script and background service worker
- Basic AI mode toggle (currently unlocked for testing)

**‚ùå Major Gaps Identified:**
- **No Backend Infrastructure**: Missing serverless functions for credit tracking and AI proxy
- **No Credit System**: No trial credits, counter, or usage limits
- **No User Identity**: Missing chrome.identity integration for anonymous tracking
- **No Trial Flow**: No free trial ‚Üí BYOK conversion experience
- **No Circuit Breaker**: Missing global budget controls (high financial risk)
- **No A/B Testing**: Missing cohort assignment and model validation framework

### **üéØ Upgrade Strategy: Brownfield Enhancement**

This is a **significant brownfield enhancement** that requires both frontend updates and completely new backend infrastructure. The approach preserves existing functionality while adding the metered freemium model.

### **üìã Structured Upgrade Plan**

I've created a task-based plan following BMad's brownfield methodology:

1. **Document Current State** - Comprehensive codebase analysis
2. **Create Enhancement Plan** - Detailed brownfield requirements
3. **Epic 1: Backend Infrastructure** - Serverless APIs, database, circuit breaker
4. **Epic 2: Identity & Credits** - User tracking, credit system, UI updates
5. **Epic 3: Trial Experience** - Processing pipeline, conversion flow
6. **Epic 4: Integration & Testing** - End-to-end testing, QA validation

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Risks & Priorities**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking):**
- **Global Budget Circuit Breaker** - "Non-negotiable" per PRD for financial protection
- **Credit System** - Core to the business model validation
- **Backend Infrastructure** - Foundation for everything else

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- A/B testing framework for model optimization
- User experience and conversion flow
- Error handling and monitoring

### **üöÄ Immediate Next Steps**

I'm currently working on **Task 1: Document Current Application State**. This will create comprehensive documentation of your existing codebase to guide the development team.

**Would you like me to:**
1. **Continue with documentation** - Run the `document-project` task to analyze your codebase
2. **Start planning** - Move to creating the brownfield enhancement plan
3. **Focus on a specific epic** - Dive deep into backend infrastructure or another area
4. **Review architecture** - Examine the integration strategy in detail

The upgrade will transform your current BYOK-only extension into the metered freemium model specified in PRD v3.0 while maintaining all existing functionality. This is exactly the type of systematic brownfield enhancement that BMad-Method excels at managing.

What would you like to focus on first?
