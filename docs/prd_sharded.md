# 0. Final Decisions & Strategic Approach

*   **Phased Approach:** The MVP will be a **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Extension**. This allows for a fast, low-risk launch to prove market fit. A full **Usage-Based SaaS Model** (with integrated billing and API keys) is planned for a future phase, contingent on the MVP's success.
*   **BYOK Provider:** Support any **OpenAI-compatible endpoint** with **OpenRouter as the default provider**; allow a **manual base URL** override.
*   **Pro Pricing:** The launch price will be **$3/mo or $29/yr**, with a potential launch promotion.
*   **License UX:** The MVP will use a simple **local license flag** to unlock Pro features, avoiding the complexity of the Chrome Web Store licensing API at launch.

---
`==================== START: docs/prd/goals.md ====================`
# 1. Goals

*   Deliver fast, reliable clean/structure/export from any webpage selection with citations.
*   Win developers & researchers with a dedicated Code & Docs mode.
*   Monetize at launch with a Pro tier: Prompt-Ready Bundles powered by user's own API keys (BYOK).
`==================== END: docs/prd/goals.md ====================`

---
`==================== START: docs/prd/non-goals.md ====================`
# 2. Non-Goals (Postponed for future versions)

*   Pipelines (#8) - *Scheduled for 2-4 weeks post-launch.*
*   OCR/Transcripts (#10, #11)
*   Multi-page binder (#12)
*   Content deduplication (#13)
*   Entity extraction (#14)
*   Hosted AI inference or background scraping.
*   Internationalization (i18n) — deferred post‑MVP (revisit ~2 weeks after launch).
`==================== END: docs/prd/non-goals.md ====================`

---
`==================== START: docs/prd/personas.md ====================`
# 3. Personas

*   **Developer:** Cleans API docs, PRs/issues, stack traces, blog posts into prompt-ready MD/JSON.
*   **Researcher/Student:** Structures articles/papers into headings, quotes, and references.
`==================== END: docs/prd/personas.md ====================`

---
`==================== START: docs/prd/user-stories.md ====================`
# 4. User Stories (MVP)

*   As a user, I can press a hotkey or click the extension to clean and structure selected content into Markdown/JSON.
*   As a dev, I can accurately preserve code blocks, tables, and stack traces.
*   As a researcher, I can export content with the canonical URL, timestamp, and quotes preserved.
*   As a Pro user, I can export content as a role-primed prompt bundle (system + task + content) using my own API key for optional formatting/validation.
`==================== END: docs/prd/user-stories.md ====================`

---
`==================== START: docs/prd/core-features.md ====================`
# 5. Core Features

*   **One-Click Clean Copy (#1):** Selection → clean → structure → export (MD/JSON).
*   **Code & Docs Mode (#3):** Preserves code fences, API tables, stack traces; uses heuristics per site class.
*   **Cite-First Capture (#9):** Includes canonical URL, timestamp, selection hash; preserves quoted snippets.
*   **Pro at Launch:**
    *   **Prompt-Ready Bundles (#18):** Exportable kits with system, task, and content blocks.
    *   **BYOK Adapter (#22):** Allows users to provide their own API key to optionally refine/validate output.

`==================== START: docs/prd/requirements.md ====================`
# 6. Requirements

## Functional

*   Triggered by hotkey and toolbar action.
    *   Default hotkey: **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P** (for "Prompt"). Less likely to conflict than K. User‑configurable post‑MVP.
*   Deterministic cleaner (Readability.js + DOM heuristics + boilerplate filters).
*   Structurer creates H1–H3, lists, tables, code fences, and blockquotes.
*   Export options: copy to clipboard, save as `.md`, download as `.json`.
    *   File naming convention: `<title>__YYYY-MM-DD__hhmm__hash.(md|json)` (e.g., `My-Article__2024-07-25__1430__a1b2c3d4.md`). Unsafe characters sanitized.
*   Modes: General and Code & Docs (toggle in popup/settings).
*   Citations: URL, timestamp, optional quoted-lines block, selection hash.
*   Pro: Bundles editor (choose system/task template), BYOK settings (OpenAI-compatible first).

#### Settings schema (MVP)

Stored in `chrome.storage.local`.

```json
{
  "mode": "general" | "code_docs",
  "templates": { "bundles": [] },
  "byok": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "apiBase": "https://openrouter.ai/api",
    "apiKey": "",
    "model": "" // dropdown list with manual override supported
  },
  "privacy": { "telemetryEnabled": false }
}
```

## Non-Functional

*   **Platform:** Chrome MV3 with minimal permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`.
*   **Browser support target:** Chromium stable released ~12 months prior to launch (pin exact minimum version during release prep).
*   **Privacy:** Local-first, no server storage, explicit user action for any network call (BYOK only).
*   **Performance:** Process a typical article in <300ms; long documents <1.5s on a mid-tier laptop.
*   **Accessibility:** Keyboard-first navigation, ARIA labels for popup/settings.
*   **Quality:** ≥85% of exports require “no manual fix needed” on a test set of 30 diverse pages.

# 7. Lean Backlog

*   **EXT-2:** Settings page (modes, templates list, BYOK key field).

## Epic: Clean & Structure (#1)

*   **CLS-1:** Selection capture and DOM snapshot.
*   **CLS-2:** Rule-based cleaner (Readability + boilerplate filters).
*   **CLS-3:** Structurer to Markdown.
*   **CLS-4:** JSON export model.

## Epic: Code & Docs Mode (#3)

*   **EXP-2:** Save `.md` and `.json` via downloads API.

## Epic: Pro: Prompt-Ready Bundles (#18) + BYOK (#22)

*   **PRO-1:** Bundles editor UI (system/task/content).
*   **PRO-2:** Bundle export (MD and JSON with roles).
*   **PRO-3:** BYOK settings and storage (obfuscated local storage).
*   **PRO-4:** BYOK formatter/validator call with explicit user consent UI, visible network activity indicator, per-minute local rate limit, and graceful fallback to local (non-AI-refined) output on error.
*   **PRO-5:** Pro feature gating (local flag, no server).

## Epic: QA, Compliance, and Release

*   **QA-1:** Test matrix of 30 pages (news, docs, GitHub, MDN, ArXiv, etc.).
*   **QA-2:** Accessibility audit on popup/settings.
*   **REL-1:** Chrome Web Store listing assets (icons, screenshots, GIFs, copy).
*   **LEG-1:** Privacy policy and permissions rationale document.
