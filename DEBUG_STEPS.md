# Debug Steps for Clipboard Issue

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

I found the issue! Your working commit had **auto-copy functionality** after content processing, but it was missing from the current implementation.

**Added back the auto-copy logic:**
```javascript
// Auto-copy Markdown after processing completes (like working version)
(async () => {
  try {
    await browser.runtime.sendMessage({
      type: 'EXPORT_REQUEST',
      payload: { format: 'md', action: 'copy' },
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Auto-copy request failed:', e);
  }
})();
```

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

### **Step 1: Reload Extension**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find PromptReady extension
3. Click the **reload button** (🔄)
4. Or remove and re-add from `.output/chrome-mv3` folder

### **Step 2: Test Auto-Copy**
1. **Open any webpage** with text content
2. **Click PromptReady extension icon**
3. **Click "Capture Content"** button
4. **Wait for processing** (should show progress)
5. **Look for TWO toasts**:
   - First: "Content processed successfully!" 
   - Second: "Content exported successfully!"

### **Step 3: Verify Clipboard**
1. **Open notepad** or text editor
2. **Press Ctrl+V** (Cmd+V on Mac)
3. **Expected**: Processed markdown content should appear

## 🔍 **Debug Console Messages**

**Right-click popup → "Inspect" to see popup console:**

**Expected messages after clicking "Capture Content":**
```
Content processed successfully!
Auto-copy request sent to background
```

**Go to chrome://extensions/ → click "background page":**

**Expected background messages:**
```
[Background] Using stored export data for export
[Background] Starting enhanced clipboard copy...
[Background] ✅ Content copied to clipboard successfully via offscreen
```

## 🎯 **Expected Flow**

1. **Click "Capture Content"** → Processing starts
2. **Content gets processed** → "Content processed successfully!" toast
3. **Auto-copy triggers** → Sends EXPORT_REQUEST to background
4. **Background copies to clipboard** → "Content exported successfully!" toast
5. **Content is in clipboard** → Ready to paste

## ❌ **If Still Not Working**

### **Check These:**

**1. Processing Issues:**
- Does "Content processed successfully!" toast appear?
- If NO: Content processing is failing

**2. Auto-Copy Issues:**
- Does "Content exported successfully!" toast appear?
- If NO: Auto-copy is failing

**3. Clipboard Issues:**
- Do both toasts appear but nothing in clipboard?
- If YES: Clipboard operation is failing

### **Console Error Messages:**

**Look for these errors:**
- "No content available for export" → Processing didn't store data
- "Offscreen copy failed" → Clipboard operation failed
- "Auto-copy request failed" → Message sending failed

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

**1-Minute Test:**
1. Reload extension
2. Go to any news website
3. Click extension icon
4. Click "Capture Content"
5. Wait 5 seconds
6. Press Ctrl+V in notepad

**Expected Result:** Markdown content appears in notepad

## 📋 **Report Back**

Please tell me:
1. **Do you see both success toasts?** (processed + exported)
2. **Does content appear when you paste?** (Ctrl+V test)
3. **Any error messages in console?** (red text)
4. **Which step fails?** (capture, process, copy, or paste)

**The auto-copy functionality is now restored exactly like your working commit!** 🎯
