# Task ID: 2
# Title: Backend: User Identity and Credit Tracking Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a backend service to manage user credits. This service will use `chrome.identity` to generate a stable, anonymous user ID, provision initial credits, and decrement them upon use.
# Details:
Create a serverless function endpoint `/user/status`. On first call with a new `chrome.identity` token, create a user record in a database (e.g., DynamoDB) with `userId`, `credits: 150`, and `monthlyResetDate`. Subsequent calls return the current credit count. Create another internal endpoint `/credits/decrement` for the AI proxy to call. This endpoint should be secured and only callable by other backend services. 

Schema for User Table:
- `userId` (Partition Key, String from `chrome.identity` hash)
- `creditsRemaining` (Number)
- `lastResetTimestamp` (Number)

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the credit provisioning and decrementing logic. Integration test the API endpoints: verify a new user gets 150 credits, and that calling the decrement endpoint correctly reduces the count. Test the edge case where credits are zero.
