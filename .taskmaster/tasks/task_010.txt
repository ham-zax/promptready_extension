# Task ID: 10
# Title: Feature: Implement Cite-First Capture and Footer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'Cite-First Capture' feature. For all processed content (both Offline and AI modes), capture the source URL and timestamp, and append a formatted citation footer to the output.
# Details:
In the service worker, when processing is initiated, use the `chrome.tabs` API to get the URL of the active tab. Create a timestamp with `new Date().toISOString()`. After the content is cleaned (by either engine), append a formatted string to the result. Example: `

---
*Cleaned from: [Page Title](source_url) on [Date]*`. The selection hash is a lower priority but can be implemented using a simple hashing function on the original selected text for preservation.

# Test Strategy:
Test on various websites. Process content using both Offline and AI modes. Verify that the clipboard output for both modes contains a correctly formatted citation footer with the accurate URL and a recent timestamp.
