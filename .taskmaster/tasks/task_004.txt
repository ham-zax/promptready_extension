# Task ID: 4
# Title: Extension: MV3 Scaffold and Unified Popup UI Shell
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the basic Chrome Extension using the Manifest V3 standard. Create the main popup UI with a unified interface for mode selection, credit display, and inline settings.
# Details:
Use a modern framework like React or Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS. The `manifest.json` should declare `service_worker`, `action` (for the popup), `storage`, and `identity` permissions. The popup UI should be a single view with progressively disclosed elements. Initially, it will show the 'Offline'/'AI' mode toggle. Placeholders for the credit counter and settings area should be included.

# Test Strategy:
Load the extension in Chrome. Verify the popup opens correctly. Check the browser's developer console for any manifest errors. Ensure the basic UI elements are rendered as expected.
