# Task ID: 7
# Title: Extension: Handle Credit Exhaustion & 'Upgrade to BYOK' Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the user flow for when free credits are exhausted. The AI mode should be disabled, and a clear call-to-action should be displayed, guiding the user to add their own API key.
# Details:
The UI should conditionally render based on the credit count received from the backend. If `creditsRemaining` is 0, the 'AI Mode' processing button should be disabled. A non-intrusive message and a button/link labeled 'Unlock Unlimited Use' or 'Add Your API Key' should appear. Clicking this will reveal the inline settings view for BYOK.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test by setting a user's credits to 0 in the backend database. Open the extension and verify that AI mode is disabled and the correct upgrade prompt is shown. Test that the UI reverts to normal if credits are added back.
