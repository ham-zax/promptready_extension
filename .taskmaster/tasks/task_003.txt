# Task ID: 3
# Title: Backend: AI Proxy Service for Trial Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a serverless function that acts as a secure proxy for the free trial AI mode. It will handle requests from the extension, validate credits, and call the designated AI model API.
# Details:
Create a serverless function endpoint `/proxy/ai-process`. This function will: 
1. Receive the user's anonymous token and the text to process.
2. Call the Credit Tracking Service (Task 2) to verify the user has > 0 credits. If not, return an error.
3. Call the `GPT OSS 20B` model API (hosted via Groq, as specified) using the company's secret API key.
4. On successful response, call the Credit Tracking Service to decrement the user's credit count.
5. Track the cost of the API call and update the Global Budget counter (Task 1).
6. Return the processed text to the extension.

# Test Strategy:
Integration test the entire flow: send a request, verify credit check, mock the external AI API call, verify credit decrement, and check the response format. Test failure modes: no credits, upstream API failure, etc. Use a test API key and a separate budget for testing.
